**Refer code "Hello.java".

A simple syntax piece of java program.

1** Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class.
    Java is case-sensitive : "class Hello" and "class hello" has different meaning.
    NOTE : Naming Convention:: class name should always start with an uppercase first letter.

2** JVM won't execute java code without main method.

print()::
   There is also a print() method, which is similar to println().
   The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output



Commenting Code - 
        Writing code is an exciting process of instructing the computer to complete fantastic tasks.
        Code is also read by people, and we want our intentions to be clear to humans just like we want our instructions to be clear to the computer.
        We can also write  comments, notes to human readers of our code. These comments are not executed, so thereâ€™s no need for valid syntax within a comment.

        Types of Commenting :
            01. When comments are short we use the single-line syntax: //.
            02. When comments are long we use the multi-line syntax: /* and */
